# Football Prediction Web App (Work in Progress)

A personal project exploring the use of machine learning to predict football match outcomes. The project is currently focused on **web scraping and data collection**, building a dataset that will later be used to train and evaluate predictive models.

## Current Features
- Web scraping football match data from online sources using **Python (BeautifulSoup, requests)**.
- Data cleaning and structuring into CSV format for further analysis.
- Modular code design to allow extension into machine learning later.

## Planned Features
- Apply machine learning models (e.g. logistic regression, decision trees, random forests) to predict match outcomes.
- Evaluate model performance (accuracy, precision, recall).
- Create a simple web interface to display predictions.

## Technologies
- Python
- BeautifulSoup, requests
- pandas (for data handling)
- scikit-learn (planned)

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/saq1b786/football-fit-checker.git
